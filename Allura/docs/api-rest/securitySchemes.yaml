        OAuth 1.0 may be used to authenticate API requests.

        Another option which is simpler in some ways is "bearer tokens":

        A bearer token (aka access token) may be generated at https://forge-allura.apache.org/auth/oauth/ and used
        in an HTTP header like:

        `Authorization: Bearer MY_BEARER_TOKEN`

          or in a URL like

        `?access_token=MY_BEARER_TOKEN`

        To use bearer tokens, choose "Anonymous" security and then use the Authorization header to enter your Bearer token.
    type: OAuth 1.0
    settings:
      requestTokenUri: https://forge-allura.apache.org/rest/oauth/request_token
      authorizationUri: https://forge-allura.apache.org/rest/oauth/authorize
      tokenCredentialsUri: https://forge-allura.apache.org/rest/oauth/access_token

- oauth_2_0:

        OAuth 2.0 may be used to authenticate API requests.

        First authorize your application at https://forge-allura.apache.org/auth/oauth2/authorize with following
        query string parameters:
          - response_type=code
          - client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
          - redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI

        For PKCE support send these additional parameters
          - code_challenge=YOUR_CODE_CHALLENGE
          - code_challenge_method=S256

        An authorization code will be generated which can be exchanged for an access token at https://forge-allura.apache.org/rest/oauth2/token
        with the following parameters:
          - grant_type=authorization_code
          - code=YOUR_AUTHORIZATION_CODE
          - client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
          - client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
          - redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI

        For PKCE support send these additional parameters
          - code_verifier=YOUR_CODE_VERIFIER

        Use the access token in an HTTP header like:

        `Authorization: Bearer MY_BEARER_TOKEN`
    type: OAuth 2.0
    settings:
      authorizationUri: https://forge-allura.apache.org/auth/oauth2/authorize
      accessTokenUri: https://forge-allura.apache.org/rest/oauth2/token
      authorizationGrants:
        - authorization_code
        - refresh_token
      scopes:
        -
